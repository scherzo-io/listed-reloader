# VERCEL BUILD FIX

## Issue
The Vercel build was failing with the following error:
```
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer gatsby@"^2.0.0" from gatsby-plugin-webpack-bundle-analyzer@1.0.5
```

## Root Cause
`gatsby-plugin-webpack-bundle-analyzer` version 1.0.5 requires Gatsby v2, but we're using Gatsby v4.25.9. This creates a peer dependency conflict that prevents the build from completing on Vercel.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed the incompatible plugin** from `gatsby-config.js`
2. **Uninstalled the packages**: 
   - `gatsby-plugin-webpack-bundle-analyzer`
   - `webpack-bundle-analyzer`
3. **Removed the analyze script** from `package.json`

## Changes Made

### gatsby-config.js
Removed the following plugin configuration:
```javascript
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-webpack-bundle-analyzer',
  options: {
    production: true,
    disable: !process.env.ANALYZE_BUNDLE,
    generateStatsFile: true,
    analyzerMode: 'static',
  },
}
```

### package.json
- Removed `"analyze": "ANALYZE_BUNDLE=true gatsby build"` script
- Removed the devDependencies

## Impact
- ✅ Build will now complete successfully on Vercel
- ✅ No functionality is affected (bundle analyzer was only for development optimization)
- ✅ All other optimizations remain in place

## Git Commands to Apply Fix
```bash
# The fix has been committed locally:
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix Vercel build: Remove incompatible gatsby-plugin-webpack-bundle-analyzer"

# Push to your repository:
git push origin master
```

## Note
If you need bundle analysis in the future, consider using:
- `gatsby-plugin-webpack-bundle-analyzer-v2` for Gatsby v4 compatibility
- Or use the built-in Gatsby build analysis tools

## Verification
After pushing, Vercel should automatically trigger a new build that will complete successfully.
