# Contentful Integration Status

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Contentful Connection Established
- Space ID: `tnmpb33y98ua` 
- Successfully connected to your Contentful space
- GraphQL queries return your 32 artists correctly

### 2. Your Content Structure in Contentful

```javascript
// Artist Content Type Fields
{
  title: "Artist Name",        // e.g., "Atish"
  slug: "URL slug",            // e.g., "atish"
  featuredImage: Asset,        // Artist photo
  bio: RichText,              // Biography
  socialLinks: JSON Object,   // All social media links
  dateCreated: Date,
  gigwellAgencyId: String,
  gigwellArtistId: String,
  gigwellSettings: String,
  gigwellStandaloneProfile: String
}
```

### 3. Available Artists (32 total)
- Galen, Atish, Atnarko, and 29 more...

## 📋 Integration Files Created

1. **Templates:**
   - `src/templates/ContentfulArtist.js` - Individual artist pages
   - `src/templates/ArtistPageContentful.js` - Artists listing page
   - `src/components/ContentfulArtistSection.js` - Artist grid component

2. **Configuration:**
   - Updated `gatsby-config.js` with Contentful source plugin
   - Updated `gatsby-node.js` to create pages from Contentful

3. **Dependencies Installed:**
   - `gatsby-source-contentful@7.21.0` (Gatsby 4 compatible)
   - `@contentful/rich-text-react-renderer`
   - `react-social-icons`

## 🚀 How to View Your Contentful Content

### Option 1: Replace Current Artists Page
To immediately see Contentful artists on /artists, update the page template in `gatsby-node.js`:

```javascript
// In gatsby-node.js, find where the artists page is created and update:
if (parsedFilePath.name === 'artists' && parsedFilePath.dir === 'pages') {
  // Use Contentful template instead
  component = path.resolve(`src/templates/ArtistPageContentful.js`)
}
```

### Option 2: Create a New Route
Visit a different URL to see Contentful artists:
- Create a new page at `src/pages/artists-contentful.js`
- Import and use `ContentfulArtistSection` component

### Option 3: Update Existing Components
Modify your current `ArtistSection` component to pull from Contentful instead of markdown.

## 🔍 Test Your Integration

### GraphQL Playground
Visit http://localhost:8000/___graphql and run:

```graphql
{
  allContentfulArtist(limit: 5) {
    nodes {
      title
      slug
      bio {
        raw
      }
      socialLinks {
        internal {
          content
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Direct API Check
Your artists are accessible via GraphQL. Sample query result:
```json
{
  "Galen": "galen",
  "Atish": "atish", 
  "Atnarko": "atnarko"
}
```

## 🔧 Next Steps to Complete Integration

### 1. Update Page Creation Logic
The artist pages need to be properly routed. Currently, markdown pages are still being used for `/artists/*` routes.

### 2. Social Links Parsing
Your social links are stored as JSON in Contentful. The template handles this, but ensure your Contentful entries have proper JSON format:
```json
{
  "facebook": "https://facebook.com/artist",
  "instagram": "https://instagram.com/artist",
  "soundcloud": "https://soundcloud.com/artist",
  "spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/artist/...",
  "soundcloudWidget": "embed URL",
  "youtubeWidget": "embed URL",
  "spotifyWidget": "embed URL"
}
```

### 3. Productions & Contact Pages
You also have Productions and Contact Page content in Contentful that can be integrated similarly.

## 📝 Important Notes

- Your Contentful content is loading correctly in GraphQL
- The templates are ready to display your content
- You can run both markdown and Contentful simultaneously during migration
- Artist URLs will remain the same: `/artists/[slug]`

## 🎯 Quick Test

To quickly test if everything is working, create this test page:

`src/pages/test-contentful.js`:
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import Layout from '../components/Layout'
import ContentfulArtistSection from '../components/ContentfulArtistSection'

export default () => (
  <Layout>
    <h1>Contentful Artists Test</h1>
    <ContentfulArtistSection />
  </Layout>
)
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8000/test-contentful
